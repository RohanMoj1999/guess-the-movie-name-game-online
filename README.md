# Guess-the-movie-game-online
Let's see whether you can guess the correct movie or not  ;)

The game is built using ```python``` language and one can play the game using python terminal.
In this game, I have installed ```IMDB``` library to fetch random movie name from IMDB database

### Installing IMDB library
```pip install IMDBpy``` in the terminal to install the library.

### Difference between ONLINE and OFFLINE versions
1. **ONLINE** version requires _internet connection_ to fetch a movie name from library and takes some time to load. **OFFLINE** version starts instantly.
2. Limited movie names in **OFFLINE** version as the movie names are manually inserted by owner. Whereas in **ONLINE** version, there's a huge database.

### Video Output
The video output is almost same incase of **ONLINE** version too except that it takes some time to load:-
