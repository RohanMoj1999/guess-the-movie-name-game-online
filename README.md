# Guess-the-movie-game-online
Let's see whether you can guess the correct movie or not  ;)

The game is built using ```python``` language and one can play the game using python terminal.
In this game, I have installed ```IMDB``` library to fetch random movie name from IMDB database

### Installing IMDB library
```pip install IMDBpy``` in the terminal to install the library.

### Difference between ONLINE and OFFLINE versions
1. ONLINE version requires _internet connection_ to fetch a movie name from library and takes some time to load. OFFLINE version starts instantly.
2. Limited movie names in OFFLINE version as the movie names are manually inserted by owner. Whereas in ONLINE version, there's a huge database.

### Video Output
Here is a small demo to show how the game looks like:-
